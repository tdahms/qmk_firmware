# Glorious GMMK Pro / ANSI - enhanced for MacOS

Modifed default keymap for use with MacOS, i.e swapped ALT and GUI keys, added RGB brightness to Fn + F5/F6, media control Fn + F7-F9, volume control Fn + F10-F12 in addition to rotary nob. Delete can also be reached via Fn + Backspace and introduced some other shortcuts that are also implemented on Apple's Magic keyboard. Provided a short cut for plain RGB mode with Fn + P. Default RGB controls remain (Fn + X,S,W), extended by shortcuts to control RGB saturation.
